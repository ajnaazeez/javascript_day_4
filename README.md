# Day 4 – JavaScript Practice Tasks

This repository contains my fourth day JavaScript practice programs.
These tasks focus on string manipulation, functions, and real-world utility programs.

## Topics Covered

* String methods
* Functions
* Conditional statements
* Random value generation
* User input handling

## Programs Included

### 1. Palindrome Checker

This program checks whether a word or number is a palindrome or not.

A palindrome is a value that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:

* "madam" → Palindrome
* "racecar" → Palindrome
* "hello" → Not a palindrome

This helped me understand string reversing and comparison logic.

### 2. Random Password Generator (4–8 Characters)

This program generates a random password between 4 and 8 characters.

Features:

* Random letters and numbers
* Different password every time
* Useful for basic security practice

This helped me learn random number generation and character selection.

### 3. Temperature Converter

This program converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Formulas:

* Celsius to Fahrenheit: (C × 9/5) + 32
* Fahrenheit to Celsius: (F − 32) × 5/9

This helped me practice functions and mathematical calculations.

## What I Learned

* Working with strings in JavaScript
* Writing reusable functions
* Random number and character generation
* Building small real-life utility programs

This is my Day-4 progress in learning JavaScript
